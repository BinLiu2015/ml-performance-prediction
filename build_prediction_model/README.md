# ML performance prediction

##### Data generation
In *Generate_train_data* the code to generate benchmarks for convolutional and fully connected layers with random parameters can be found. Build the Dockerfiles *Dockerfile.dense* and *Dockerfile.conv* and run the using NVIDIA-Docker. Mount a directory into /results using the flag
'--mount type=bind,source=<path/to/folder>,target=results'
for saving results as pandas dataframes.


##### Data prediction
The data generated by the programme described above is to build a feed-forward model for predicting compute times for convolutions and fully connected layers. The data is preprocessed using the jupyter notebooks in *prepare_train_data*. The model can be trained using the jupyter notebook *model_compTime.ipynb*.

A full neural network can be defined by a .json file in *model_architecture*. The execution time can be inferred using the jupyter notebook *Full_model_prediction.ipynb*.
